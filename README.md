## Tic Tac Toe (Java)

A simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game developed in Java. The game allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3×3 grid, checks for winning conditions after each move, and declares the winner or a draw accordingly. This project demonstrates basic Java concepts such as loops, conditionals, arrays, and user input handling.
